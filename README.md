# Mark's Obsidian Vault

## 2024.01.20

Have heard and learned about Obsidian from assorted YouTube videos. The idea of saving notes as text files to avoid getting locked into a proprietary format is well known, but pure text files would lose the ability to format (headers, lists, italics, embedded pictures, etc.) - until nowadays Markdown files are common and decently supported. Plus the assorted ways to tag, cross-link and organize text notes replicates the functionality of assorted proprietary knowledge bases.

So! Over the years I've accummulated notes in various tools and places
- Personal Knowbase (Windows only)
- Google Keep (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, etc.)
- Facebook
- Bersalona.com

My notes in Personal Knowbase are the highest priority to bring into Obsidian, since Personal Knowbase is proprietary. But I'll probably practice using Obsidian first: **will start with recipes**.

### To sync or not to sync
The neat thing about Obsidian is that it is free for personal use. They do charge for syncing and for publishing, as well as for commercial use.

- The beauty of Obsidian's files is that they are stored locally - but therefore are accessible only locally, i.e. in 1 place
- Syncing should allow copies of one's Obsidian vault in multiple locations - so your "second brain" is accessible in more than one device.
- **Can syncing also be done by saving one's vault in GitHub** (or other Git repository)? I'm so far not being charged to use GitHub, so maybe that'll work too...

### What about privacy?
If I save my vault to GitHub, at some point I may want to make the vault's repository private (as much as something on GitHub can be private).
