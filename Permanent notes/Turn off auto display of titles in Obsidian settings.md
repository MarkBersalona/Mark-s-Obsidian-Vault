# Turn off auto display of titles in Obsidian settings
Created: 2024.01.21 1007

When I first started using Obsidian, whenever I created a new note, the title would automatically be displayed at the top of the note, as if within the note.
- It was confusing when I first created the NewNote template
- Resulting notes did NOT have the title embedded within the actual note
	- Inspecting the .md file separately from Obsidian confirmed this

In Obsidian settings, can turn off this feature
- Settings > Appearance > Show inline title
- was enabled by default
