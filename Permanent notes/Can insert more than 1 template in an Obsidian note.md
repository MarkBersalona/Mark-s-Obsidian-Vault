# Can insert more than 1 template in an Obsidian note
Created: 2024.01.21 1012

I added the title to existing notes by creating the 'Title' template
- single line of H1 header and title variable
- be sure to have CR/LF at the end of the line

Then in an Obsidian note missing a title header, put the cursor at the start of the note and insert the Title template
