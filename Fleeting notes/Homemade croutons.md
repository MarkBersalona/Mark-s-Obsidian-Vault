Day-old bread (French, Italian, whole grain loaf, etc.)  
Salt  
Pepper  
Red pepper flakes (optional!)  
Olive oil  
  
Preheat oven to 400 degF  
Cut bread into cubes, say 1/2 to 1 inch sides; put in bowl

Put mixture on baking sheet, single-layer  
Bake for about 15 minutes  
Avoid taking too many samples right out of the oven; save for the salad!
