The palm oil finally arrived, so today will be my first attempt at making soap at home - specifically, a lathering pine tar soap based on the following cold-process recipe. (All values by weight)  
  
Coconut oil - 16 oz. (453.6 g)  
Olive oil - 16 oz. (453.6 g)  
Palm oil - 16 oz. (453.6 g)  
Castor oil - 2 oz. (56.7g)  
Pine tar - 4 oz. (113.4 g)  
  
Water, distilled - 20.52 oz. (581.73 g)  
Lye - NaOH - 7.41 oz. (210 g)  
  
The lye stays in the garage, I will be using gloves, breathing filter, safety glasses and all other precautions while dealing with it; will bring the oils and the water into the garage as needed.

I added the pine tar to the oils and mixed well BEFORE adding the lye water. I hit trace in about 1-2 minutes but kept on stirring for maybe 1-2 more minutes before pouring into the mold - texture looked a bit gritty, and by the time I was scraping the last stuff from the bowl it had the consistency of a gritty cake batter. I tried to level the stuff out as much as possible, but I probably should have poured it into the mold earlier. The bowl and the spatulas have plenty of leftovers, so I can check on that stuff without bothering the real soap loaf over the next 24 hours. Hopefully the leftovers will help tell me if it has cured enough to cut into bars tomorrow.
