## INGREDIENTS
2 Tablespoons Poultry Seasoning  
2 Tablespoons Garlic Powder  
2 Tablespoons Onion Powder  
2 chicken-flavored bouillon cubes  
1 teaspoon black pepper {We’re not big fans of pepper, so feel free to add more if you think it needs more.}  

## DIRECTIONS
1. Crush your bouillon cubes into powder. You can do this in a food processor or by hand.  
2. Mix all ingredients together.  
3. Place in an airtight jar. {I used one of these Ball Herb Jars and it’s perfect.}
