Created: 2022.09.19

## Ingredients:  
1 pound of ground beef  
½ of a pound of ground veal  
½ of a pound of ground pork  
2 large eggs  
1 cup grated Pecorino Romano Cheese or Parmesan Cheese (Freshly grated is best)  
2 tbsp. fresh parsley  
1 clove fresh garlic peeled and minced  
2 cups freshly ground Italian breadcrumbs (Add salt & pepper to taste)  
2 cups luke-warm water (I use 1 ½ cups)  
1 cup fine-quality olive oil  
  
## Directions  
In food processor grind up a loaf of 2 day old hard Italian bread.  
  
Combine beef, veal and pork in mixing bowl along with eggs, cheese, garlic, parsley, salt & pepper. Blend together with hands or spoon, (Do not over mix). Add breadcrumbs and 1 cup of the water and continue to mix while adding the remaining cup of water.  
  
Shape meatballs into 2 in. balls (I use an ice cream scooper).  
  
Heat oil in large sauté pan (High to medium heat)  
  
When oil is hot not smoking, fry meatballs in batches turning balls when sides are golden brown cooking each side 5 to 6 minutes  
  
Remove from heat and place on paper towels.  
  
Serve with your favorite Rao’s jarred sauce or sauce of your choice.  
(I use Rao’s Marinara sauce)  
  
## Recipe notes:  
In place of fresh breadcrumbs you can use store bought plain breadcrumbs but, fresh is better.
