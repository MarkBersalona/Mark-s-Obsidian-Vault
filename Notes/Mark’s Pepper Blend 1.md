# Mark’s Pepper Blend 1
Created: 2016.07.10

My last attempt many months ago (a year ago maybe?) to mix a blend of peppercorns started as an equal blend by weight of black, white, green and pink peppercorns. It didn’t taste right, so I added more black peppercorns to taste better. What I didn’t realize was that green and pink peppercorns weigh less than black and white peppercorns.  
  
Today I ran out of that ad hoc blend, so I mixed another blend. This is the mix _by weight_:  
  
6 oz. black (or 6 units)  
2 oz. white (or 2 units)  
1 oz. green (or 1 unit)  
1 oz. pink (or 1 unit)  
  
I have a glass bottle which originally held 10 oz. of a commercial pepper blend. Mark’s Pepper Blend #1 filled this bottle and topped off both my pepper mills. This tells me the commercial pepper blend was probably heavier with the black peppercorns - might have been heavier with the white also, but since the black peppercorns are less expensive, I’m betting they went with the cheaper blend.  
  
Mark’s Pepper Blend #1 looks good visually, and it smells good. Let’s see how it tastes.
