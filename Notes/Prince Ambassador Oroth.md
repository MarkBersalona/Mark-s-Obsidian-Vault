- They are a highly sought-after couple in Sarville socials

The fact that the ambassador is stationed permanently instead of a visiting ambassador "at-large", plus that the ambassador is a royal prince, is an apparent demonstration that the emperor greatly esteems the alliance with Sarahton.

Prince Oroth is technically a candidate to succeed his father, Emperor Amon O XVI; however other brothers of his are widely seen as more likely, e.g. Prince Hoth.

Open secret that both Prince Oroth and Princess Wilhelmina have outside discreet affairs and dalliances.

Princess Wilhelmina also strongly desires to rule the Empire, schemed to reach her current position, but so far is (justifiably) seen by the court as harmless
