### Chapter 2

True or False: Since stocks can go up or down, the longer you own stocks the more you risk losing money overall.

Discuss the validity of the following: Putting all your money in one company's stock is risky, like putting all your eggs in one basket. Better to diversify by owning stock in several companies or putting money in a stock mutual fund, which owns stock of several companies.

True or False: I can't lose money with corporate bonds, at worst they pay it off early, but I get my money back at the end regardless.


### Chapter 3

Which is NOT a way for a company to raise money to grow itself?
A) Issue stocks in the company
B ) Issue bonds from the company
C) Take loans from commercial banks
D) Beg and borrow from the friends and family of the company's owner(s)
E) These are all ways a company might raise money

Cindy's Kitchen (CKT) through a successful IPO has issued 1 million shares of stock in itself. The current stock price is $10/share. CKT earns $2 per share. What is CKT's P/E ratio? Bonus question: How much is CKT worth as a company?

Evaluate the following: If interest rates are  high, consumer inflation will actually be low. This is because (in the USA anyway) the economy is consumer-driven, and if consumers must pay higher interest on loans, credit card bills, mortgages, etc., they have less free income to spend on things, so demand is less. This hampers businesses' ability to raise prices.


## Book 2

### Chapter 1

Which should you do first?
A) Establish 3-12 month emergency fund
B ) Pay off high-interest credit card bills
C) Start saving for childrens' or grandchildrens' college fund
D) Invest in high-risk, high-growth stocks or stock mutual funds
E) Take advantage of low- or no-interest car financing deals

True or False: There is usually a penalty for withdrawing from a retirement account before retirement, even though it's your money.
