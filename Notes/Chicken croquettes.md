Nothing reminds me of a diner more than the classics! Chicken croquettes bring me back to trips to the diner back in the day! Big pile of mashed potatoes with pyramids of fried chicken goodness smothered in a thick yellow gravy! You just don’t find them anymore! Well, like bell bottoms, let’s bring this classic back to life with a nice easy recipe that you can do at home with ingredients probably already on hand!  
  
## INGREDIENTS  
### Croquettes  
2 cups roasted chicken, shredded  
1 (10 1/2 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup  
1 (6 ounce) box seasoned stuffing mix, mix for poultry  
1 large egg, slightly beaten  
1/2 teaspoon onion powder  
1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning  
1 teaspoon dried parsley  
breadcrumbs, for dredging  
1 cup vegetable oil, for frying (may need more or less)  
  
### Gravy

## DIRECTIONS  
### Croquettes  
Mix the chicken, soup, stuffing mix, egg, onion powder, parsley, and poultry seasoning.
