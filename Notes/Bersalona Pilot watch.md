## DIRECTIONS  
  
Remove existing crystal. If the case did not come with a yellow chapter ring, replace existing chapter ring with a yellow chapter ring. Install flat, blue AR-coated sapphire crystal.  
Remove extraneous dial feet from the dial and install the dial onto the movement. Install hands. Verify all hands can move without interference (with temporary stem and crown: move hour and minute hands across 12 hours; wind movement and verify seconds hand moves properly).  
  
Clean the interior side of the crystal (alcohol lens wipe tissue is useful here) and blow interior of case free of dust. Remove stem and install movement assembly (movement, dial and hands) into case.  
  
Install case crown temporarily onto uncut stem, and install into cased movement. Verify movement operation (wind and verify seconds hand moves properly; verify hacking; verify time setting; verify resumption of time keeping). If available, verify movement operation on timegrapher  
  
(Optional) Remove existing rotor, replace with fancy rotor. Verify rotor operation.  
  
Trim stem to correct length for the case. Reinstall crown and verify stem operation (push in to start time keeping; pull out to hack and set time; push in to resume time keeping; screw down into case).  
  
Clean the interior side of caseback and blow free of dust. Install caseback. Verify rotor operation.  
  
(Optional) Remove bezel and unidirectional click spring. Install bidirectional click spring. Reinstall bezel.  
  
Rotate bezel clockwise until stopped (or centered if bidirectional click spring is installed). Install countdown bezel with proper alignment to dial and chapter ring (if bezel has adhesive ring installed, remove paper guard; remove paper guards on adhesive strips on bezel insert)
